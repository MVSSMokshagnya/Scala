This repo contains the router and compiler services for KojoJS.

### Instructions for using with IntelliJ Idea:
* Import sbt project
* Open sbt shell
* Run `router/reStart` to get the router going. The kojojs-editor web-server should be running at this point.
* Run `compilerServer/reStart` to get the compiler service going
* Navigate to localhost:9000 to start using KojoJS
